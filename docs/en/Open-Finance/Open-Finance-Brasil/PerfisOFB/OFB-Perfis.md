# Participation Profiles

Financial institutions can participate in *Open Finance Brasil* by fulfilling several specific roles, here referred to as Participation Profiles. Some financial institutions are required to participate with specific profiles, but all institutions can voluntarily exercise all available profiles.

The profiles performed by financial institutions can be divided into the two existing ecosystems: data sharing and payments. In each of them, there is an active party (the one who initiates an action) and a passive party, which responds to the action initiated by the active party.

## In the Data Ecosystem

- **Data Transmitter** - Passive party.
- **Data Receiver** - Active party.

## In the Payments Ecosystem

- **Account Holder** - Passive party.
- **Payment Transaction Initiator (ITP)** - Active party.

## TPP Terminology

The term **TPP** (Third-Party Provider) is used to represent both active parties in the ecosystem, i.e.:

- **Data Receiver**
- **ITP**
