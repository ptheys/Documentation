To participate in Open Finance, financial institutions must complete procedures to obtain two types of certifications:

- **OpenID Security Certification**
- **Functional Certification**

Additionally, the ecosystem requires participants to acquire some digital certificates:

- **Transport Certificate**
- **EV Certificate**
- **Authentication Certificate**
- **Signature Certificate**

**Certifications and certificates are different!**

- **Certifications**: Evidence that the Open Finance Brasil implementation of participants complies with functional and security specifications.
- **Certificates**: Generated by an authorized certification body, these are used to encrypt and ensure secure communication between Open Finance Brasil participants.

## OpenID Security Certification

The security protocol adopted by Open Finance Brasil follows the requirements of the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/).

A security compliance engine ensures that an institution meets the requirements of this protocol, performing the necessary tests in the FAPI-BR layer within the OpenID framework.

### Types of Certification

1. **OpenID Providers (OP)**:
   Required for the Account Holder and Data Transmitter profiles.
2. **Relying Parties (RP)**:
   Required for the Payment Transaction Initiator (ITP) and Data Receiver profiles.

## Functional Certification

In the context of Open Finance Brasil qualification, various API specifications must be implemented by the participating institution. To ensure that the participant meets all expectations for the functionality's journey, Open Finance Brasil governance provides a functional engine. Within this engine, various test plans are provided for each regulatory API to be tested and certified based on how closely its behavior aligns with regulatory standards.

You can track published tests from participating institutions [through this link](https://web.conformance.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/plans.html?public=true).

### Certification Steps

1. Create an account on the [sandbox](https://web.sandbox.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/organisations) directory for participants.
2. Configure the [sandbox](https://web.sandbox.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/organisations) directory.
3. Certify the testing environment (OpenID Security Certification).
4. Develop the integration layer.
5. Perform the tests and obtain functional certification.

*The mandatory tests vary according to the operational profile and the products offered by the institution.*

## Digital Certificates

Digital certificates are divided into 4 types:

1. **Transport Certificate**:
   - Authenticates the MTLS channel.
   - Authenticates the client application via OAuth2.0 mTLS or private_key_jwt.

2. **EV Certificate**:
   - Used for services like web pages.

3. **Authentication Certificate**:
   - Protects and authenticates the TLS channel of the APIs consumed by Open Finance participant applications.

4. **Signature Certificate**:
   - Signs the payload using JWS (JSON Web Signature).
